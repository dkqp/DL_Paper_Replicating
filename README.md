# Deep-learning Paper Replicating with PyTorch

## Practicing purpose for implementing DL models from papers with pytorch.

While practicing,

- applying theoretical analysis related with DL
- tuning hyperparameters for known datasets
- implementing additional utilizing scripts

## Progresses

- 13 Feb 2023 - ViT architecture start
- 16 Feb 2023 - ViT architecture model created
